            MC               Size in bits of the handle stream (unsigned, 0x40 is not interpreted as
                             sign). This includes the padding bits at the end of the handle stream (the
                             padding bits make sure the object stream ends on a byte boundary).

            B                String stream present bit (last bit in pre-handles section). If 1, then the
                             “endbit” location should be decremented by 16 bytes, and a short should
                             be read at location endbit – 128 (bits), call this short strDataSize. If this
                             short has the 0x8000 bit set, then decrement endbit by an additional 16
                             bytes, strip the 0x8000 bit off of strDataSize, and read the short at this new
                             location, calling it hiSize. Then set strDataSize to (strDataSize | (hiSize
                             << 15)). “endbit” should then be decremented by this final strDataSize
                             value, and this bit location marks the start of the
                             “string stream” within this object. All unicode strings in this object are
                             located in the “string stream”, and should be read from this stream, even
                             though the location of the TV type fields in the object descriptions list
                             these fields in among the normal object data.
